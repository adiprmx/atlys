Use this skill when writing, reviewing, or optimizing Dockerfiles, even if the user just says their image is too large, their build is slow, or they need to harden a container for production. Covers multi-stage builds, layer caching, .dockerignore, non-root users, and image size optimization.

## When to use

- Creating a new Dockerfile for any language or framework
- Optimizing an existing Dockerfile for size, speed, or security
- Reviewing a Dockerfile for best-practice compliance
- Adding a .dockerignore file to a project
